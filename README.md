# Class Scheduling Optimization using Genetic Algorithms
This project demonstrates a smart way to assign tasks to robots using genetic algorithms. It optimizes task distribution based on robot efficiency, availability, and task preferences, and visualizes the process in real-time with Pygame.
# Key Features
- Dynamic Task Assignment: Assigns tasks to robots based on efficiency and availability.
- Genetic Algorithm Optimization: Uses selection, crossover, and mutation to find the best task assignments.
- Interactive Visualization: Real-time grid display showing task assignments and optimization progress.
- Customizable Settings: Adjust the number of tasks, robots, and algorithm parameters to explore different scenarios.
# Project Structure
Here's a quick overview of the files:
- agent.py: It defines the Agent class to represent robots, their efficiencies, and assigned tasks.
- environment.py: It sets up tasks, robot preferences, and availability matrices.
- run.py: It is the main script that runs the simulation.
